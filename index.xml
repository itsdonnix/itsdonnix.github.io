But I never think of making my own site/blog. Finally, I got to make it happen in 2021 ü•≥.
So, in my first post, I will tell my little story when the first time I learn programming üë®‚Äçüíª.
I started learning programming back in 2015 at STIKOM Uyelindo Kupang College.
Before Goto College It all started when I didn&amp;rsquo;t finish my education in senior high school.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>Hello&amp;hellip;
